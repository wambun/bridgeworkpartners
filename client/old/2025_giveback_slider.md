## BridgeWorkGIVES

Sharing time and treasure with those in need, BridgeWork Partners is passionate about making a positive difference in the world we live in today. We believe our society is interdependent to the business world. At BridgeWork Partners, our commitment to philanthropy will make us stronger individuals, a more vigorous company and a healthier community, as we continue to share our time and talent with those in need.

## Our Philosophy Since 2008

BridgeWork Partners dedicates a certain number of volunteer hours per month to social and civic causes on a regular basis. It is a pledge which will continue perpetually within our company. It is a pulse in our culture, in our attitudes, and in our hearts.

So much can be done to make our nation and world a better place, one step at a time, one dollar at a time. We pledge, as our social responsibility, to make a positive impact to those in need.
