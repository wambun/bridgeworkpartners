## Committed to Diversity

Since the inception of BridgeWork Partners in 2008, we have not skipped a beat as it pertains to our continued commitment and execution of building and embracing Diversity & Inclusion within our firm and those clients which we support. It is a topic we embrace with passion, and we pledge to honor this initiative.

Diversity & Inclusion that is vibrant within an organization involves continued commitment from leadership. Leadership must set the example for others to follow. We are proud of the enormous efforts of our team, our colleagues, and our partners who join with us in our quest to build and create vibrant success stories of our ongoing efforts to developing a culture of Inclusion through our staff, and through the Diversity outreach and talent acquisition we provide to our clients.

**In 2024, 91% of our candidates and consultants hired were qualified minorities.**

## Our Mentor Protégé Program

Our Mentor Protégé Partner Program is designed to help train and share knowledge on a regular basis with our strategic recruiting partners.

This partnership assists in the success of both attracting and retaining of Veterans and other qualified talent for BridgeWork Partners’ clients.
