In addition, Samantha became versed in the payroll process and effectiveness to ensure proper billing and timekeeping for our employees and clients.\n\nHer “Can Do Attitude,” eventually led her to a promotion of Recruiter. Here she gained extensive knowledge working with several clients from the onset of a business relationship, to achieving high customer service scores and references, as well as working with HR issues and service delivery recovery. She is versed in recruiting for IT & Professional positions as well as temporary positions. She spent several years involved in the recruiting and selection of candidates while working with legal compliance issues, E-Verify, and client and database management.\n\nDue to her continued success and amazing dedication, Samantha was promoted to Account Manager.
