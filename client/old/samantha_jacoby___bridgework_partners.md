She is experienced in business development and RFP writing with a proven tracked record of success. In addition, she co-leads the marketing vision and execution for BridgeWork Partners. Samantha has experience with content creation, design tools, digital marketing, social media, website creation and management, and data analytics.

Samantha joined BridgeWork Partners after graduating in 2010. Starting as a Recruiting Coordinator, Samantha assisted with all steps of the hiring process. She worked to comply with HR audits, quality control metrics, workers’ compensation, and unemployment processes to ensure timeliness of all deliverables. In addition, Samantha became versed in the payroll process and effectiveness to ensure proper billing and timekeeping for our employees and clients.

Her “Can Do Attitude,” eventually led her to a promotion of Recruiter. Here she gained extensive knowledge working with several clients from the onset of a business relationship, to achieving high customer service scores and references, as well as working with HR issues and service delivery recovery. She is versed in recruiting for IT & Professional positions as well as temporary positions. She spent several years involved in the recruiting and selection of candidates while working with legal compliance issues, E-Verify, and client and database management.

Due to her continued success and amazing dedication, Samantha was promoted to Account Manager. In this role, she worked on building client relationships while continuing to assist with job requisitions, recruitment of positions, project staffing initiatives, as well as tracking metrics for the Mentor Protégé partnerships for BridgeWork Partners’ supplier diversity and teaming relationships.

Samantha is very passionate about our philanthropy “BridgeWork _Gives_” program and has been a champion for our cause during and outside normal work hours volunteering for so many causes such as Cornerstone Ranch which is a program for adults who are mentally disabled. Samantha has been involved in numerous causes to support cancer research including M. D. Anderson in Houston, Texas and Relay for Life which benefits the American Cancer Society. She has volunteered in the burn unit at Parkland Hospital, and has dedicated time to Prevent Child Abuse America, Girl Scouts of the USA, and many other social and civic causes. Not only has Samantha volunteered locally, but she has also traveled to New York to feed the homeless and work in different shelters. In addition, Samantha has been a volunteer for the 33-year-old “Stars on the Rise” program at the Greater Dallas Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which has awarded over $33M in scholarships to disadvantaged students.

In 2015, Samantha was featured in the Dallas Morning News in an article called “Too Happy to Hop,” demonstrating the strong value the millennial workforce brings to the economy and the business world today. Her journey with BridgeWork Partners has been a fascinating one and has been filled with an incredible work ethic and passion for customer service excellence.
